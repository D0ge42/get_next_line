• Decrease number of functions used.

• Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.

• Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
reading from the standard input.

• Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your
compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
It will define the buffer size for read().
The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette
in order to test your code.

• memmove, ha bisogno di un parametro versatile.

• BUFFER_SIZE 1000
